# MyFairShare
The purpose of My Fair Share budgeting app is to allow end users to split bills proportionally based upon individualâ€™s earnings in the overall household income. The reasoning behind this app is to provide a fairer distribution of funds for those who are lower income than their peers and create a surplus of funds that they can then spend on assets and other means of saving. This is achieved by providing a tool that tackles the biggest financial burden couples and roommates share, bills.
